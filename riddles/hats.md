Prisoners with hats
==================

A prison guard is giving 10 prisoners a second chance for their death
sentences. He tells them that tomorrow he will put all the prisoners in a line
and give each prisoner a black or a white hat. The distribution of the color of
the hats will be random; the guard could give half of them black hats, or one
black and the rest white or even all of them the same color. Either way, the
prisoners do not now the distribution beforehand.

Each prisoner in this line can only see the prisoners in front of him and their
hats. He can not see his own hat nor all the persons behind him in the
line. Thus, the first prisoner in this line can see the other 9 prisoners hats
(but not his own). The second prisoner can see 8 prisoners in front of him and
so on. The last prisoner in the line does not see anyones hat (including his
own).

The guard tells them that tomorrow he will start with the first person in the
line (the one who can see the other nines hats) and ask him for his hat
color. Then he proceeds with the second prisoner in line and asks for his color,
and so on all the way to last prisoner in the line. If a prisoner tells his hat
color correctly he will be spared, otherwise he will be killed. The prisoners
can not communicate with each other in any way during this process. Also, they
can only answer the guard with either "black" or "white"; nothing else can be
uttered.

Now, the guard leaves the prisoners with these instructions and they start to
discuss a strategy for tomorrow. What is the optimal strategy in order to save
as many prisoners as possible? (Does the strategy work with _n_ prisoners?)
