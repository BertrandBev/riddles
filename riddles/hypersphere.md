Hypersphere and n-simplex tetrahedron
=====================================

Randomly select n+1 points on the surface of an n-dimensional
hypersphere. Construct an inscribed n-simplex tetrahedron (n-dimensional
triangular pyramid) containing the random points as vertices.

What is the probability that the center of the hypersphere is contained within the
n-simplex tetrahedron?
