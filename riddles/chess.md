Devil's chessboard
==================

You and your friend find yourselves in a room with the Devil. The Devil tells
you that he wants to play a game. If you win, the Devil will let you go. If you
lose, the Devil takes your souls.

Here are the rules of the game:

You and the Devil will be in a room with a chessboard with coins on it, one on
each square. Meanwhile, your friend will be outside the room. The coins will be
randomly distributed heads and tails. The Devil randomly chooses one of the
squares and calls it "the magic square". Next, you may flip one coin on a
square. Then your friend will come in, and must tell which "the magic square"
is by merely looking at the board.

Details:

* You **may** flip a coin. You may choose not to flip a coin.

* You and your friend will agree upon a strategy, before the game starts, so you
  are both aware of the strategy.

* Your friend will not see the chessboard when the coins are initially put on
  the board, i.e. cannot see a before-and-after difference after you potentially
  flipped a coin.

* You cannot use any other means to communicate with your friend during the
  game, other than the coin flip.

What will your strategy be?
