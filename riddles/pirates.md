Greedy pirates
==============

A pirate ship with *n* pirates is cruising at sea, as the pirate in the crow's
nest (upper part of the main mast) spots something shimmering in the water. The
pirates decide to anchor the ship and find the source of this shimmering, which
turns out to be a huge treasure chest filled with *p* gold coins, where
*p*>*n*. The greedy pirates all want the gold for themselves.

As they are all very rational, they come up with a system to split the
coins. They agree upon the following system: The highest ranked pirate proposes
how the coins should be split, and all pirates (including himself) vote yay or
nay on the proposal. If the proposal gets 50% or more of the votes, the proposal
is deemed accepted. However, if the proposal gets less than 50% of the votes,
the proposing pirates gets to walk the plank and the next pirate in rank
proposes a new split.

Assuming that all pirates are very rational, intelligent and greedy, what should
the proposal made by the captain?
