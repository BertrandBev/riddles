Blue eyes
=========

On a desert island, 200 people are stranded. They are all forbidden from
speaking with one another, writing messages in the sand or by any other means
communicate with each other, else they be shot dead by the captain of a
mysterious ship that visits the island each night.

Of the 200 islanders, 100 have blue eyes, and 100 have brown eyes. However, no
individual knows what color their own eyes are, nor do they know that there is a
perfect 50/50 distribution of blue and brown eyes. There are no reflective
surfaces or any other means by which they would have been able to see their own
eyes. They can each see the 199 other islanders and their eye colors, but any
given individual does not know if his or her own eyes are brown, blue, or
perhaps another color entirely.

Each night, when the captain of the ship comes, the islanders have a chance to
leave the barren and desolate spit of land they have been marooned on. If an
islander tells the captain the color of his or her own eyes, they may board the
ship and leave. If they get it wrong, they will be shot dead.

The captain has told the islanders that "At least one of you has blue eyes".

Who leaves the island? And when do they leave?
