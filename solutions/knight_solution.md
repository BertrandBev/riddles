Solution to Knight and knave
==============================

Ask any one of them "Which path would the other guard say leads to
death?". Whatever path he tells is the one leading to death, is surely leading
to freedom.

Here is why it works: The knight knows that the knave is lying, and will have
this in mind when answering which path leads to death. Hence he will point you
to the path leading to freedom (again, since he knows the knanve will lie). The
knave on the other hand, knows that the knight would point to the one leading to
death, but will lie about it.

Conclusion, the question of "what would the other guy say" will for sure have a
negated answer, i.e. asking for death will point you to freedom, asking for
freedom will point you to death.
