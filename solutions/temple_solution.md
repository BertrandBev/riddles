Solution to cursed temple
=========================

As you are not cursed, you can check one hallway by yourself. You just came from
the hallway leading to the altar, so no need to check that one. Now there are
three ways left. Split the students into three groups, one duo and two trios,
and send the groups down one hallway each.

Here are the possible outcomes:

* Only one group claims to have found the exit: Perfect, you can trust everyone
  in this case.

* Everyone claims that their path was the wrong one: This can only happen if
  both cursed students are in the duo, and both are lying. Hence, their path is
  the way out.

* Two groups claim that their path was the right one: Same rationale as when
  everyone claims that their path was the wrong one

* The students in the duo disagree with each other: There is at least
  one lier in this group. There might be a lier in one of the trios, but you can
  trust the majority, and all the students in the trio with a unanimous answer.

* Only the students in a trio disagree with each other: There is at least
  one lier in this group. You can trust all other groups and the majority in this group.

* The students in **both** trios disagree with each other: There is exactly one
  liar in each trio. You can trust the majority in both trios, and you can trust
  the duo.

* The students in one of the trios, and the duo, disagree with each other: There
  is exactly one liar in the disagreeing trio, and one in the duo. You can trust
  the majority in the trio and you can trust the other trio. If the
  majority in the trios claim to not have found the exit, then the duo must have
  found it. Despite their disagreement you know this for sure.

* The exit is on your own path: Well, no questions here.
