Solution to Circular palace
===========================

If you are in the room with lights off, turn them on. If lights are on, leave
them on.

Walk the hallway counting rooms as you pass them, until you find a room with
lights on, and turn it off. Return to the initial room (according to the
count). If lights are off, you just made the full circle, and you are
done. Otherwise, keep iterating.
